   <h1>Learn CSS 3.0 for better web design</h1>

   <div>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. </div>
    
   <div>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous. </div>

   <div>As knowledge increases, wonder deepens.</div>
   
   <p>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.</p>

   <p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>

   <p>It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. </p>

   <p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.</p>

   <p>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself. </p>
